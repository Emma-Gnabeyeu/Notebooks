Data Challenge 2022
===================

We provide:
*** A Jupyter notebook 'datachallengesinf554' with our analysis and the different paths we tried.
*** A python code 'Tweetpred.py' of the best model we used.
*** Our report.


In order to run 'Tweetpred.py', put 'train.csv' and 'evaluation.csv' in the same folder as 'Tweetpred.py'.


The main libraries we use are sklearn and nltk.
